## üî¨ Overview

This work introduces a novel **Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based framework** for tackling the **joint power control and spectrum allocation** problem in wireless communication networks. It targets Device-to-Device (D2D) communication in complex interference environments where traditional resource allocation techniques fall short due to the non-Euclidean structure of wireless topologies.

## üìä Results & Visualizations

### üìç Simulation Setup:  
- **Area**: 500m x 500m  
- **Topology**: 50 D2D links  
- **Minimum data rate constraint**: `1000 Kbps`  
- **Bandwidth**: 10 Resource Blocks (RBs) of 500 Hz each  

### üìà Performance Visualization

## üß† Abstract

The rising complexity of wireless environments driven by modern applications and user demands challenges traditional Radio Resource Management (RRM) frameworks. Although Deep Learning (DL) approaches offer adaptive solutions, most are limited to **Euclidean data structures**, ignoring the **graph-based nature** of wireless topologies.

This work proposes a GNN-based model that directly operates on **non-Euclidean representations** of wireless networks, enabling efficient joint optimization of power control and spectrum allocation. The framework:
- Adapts to varying interference conditions
- Supports flexible bandwidth allocation
- Maintains robust performance in imperfect channel conditions  
Experimental results demonstrate clear advantages in **convergence speed**, **generalization**, and **robustness** over existing solutions.
